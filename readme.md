## üìñ Overview

`infux` is a lightweight yet powerful in-memory caching library for Go. It's built with performance in mind, utilizing a **sharded map** approach to significantly reduce lock contention and maximize concurrent access. Whether you're building a web service, a data processing pipeline, or any application requiring fast access to frequently used data, `infux` provides a reliable and efficient solution.

### ‚ú® Key Features

  * **High Performance:** Optimized for speed through minimized lock contention.
  * **Thread-Safe:** Safe for concurrent use across multiple goroutines.
  * **Sharded Architecture:** Employs a sharded map with FNV-1a hashing for even key distribution and reduced contention.
  * **Simple API:** Easy to integrate and use with a straightforward interface.
  * **In-Memory:** Blazing fast access to cached data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start using `infux` in your Go project, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

First, you need to fetch the library using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/VectroLabs/infux
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a quick example demonstrating how to create a cache, set, get, and delete items.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/VectroLabs/infux"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new cache instance
	cache := infux.New()

	// Set a key-value pair
	key := "myKey"
	value := []byte("myValue")
	cache.Set(key, value)
	fmt.Printf("Set: %s -> %s\n", key, string(value))

	// Get an item from the cache
	val, found := cache.Get(key)
	if found {
		fmt.Printf("Get: %s -> %s (found)\n", key, string(val))
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Get: %s (not found)\n", key)
	}

	// Try to get a non-existent key
	_, found = cache.Get("nonExistentKey")
	if !found {
		fmt.Printf("Get: nonExistentKey (not found as expected)\n")
	}

	// Delete an item
	cache.Delete(key)
	fmt.Printf("Deleted: %s\n", key)

	// Try to get the deleted item
	_, found = cache.Get(key)
	if !found {
		fmt.Printf("Get: %s (not found after deletion)\n", key)
	}
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Reference

### `infux.New()`

Creates a new `infux` cache instance.

### `cache.Set(key string, value []byte)`

Sets a key-value pair in the cache.

- `key`: The key to set.
- `value`: The value to associate with the key.

### `cache.Get(key string) ([]byte, bool)`

Retrieves a value from the cache based on the provided key.

- `key`: The key to retrieve.
- Returns:
  - `[]byte`: The value associated with the key, if found.
  - `bool`: A boolean indicating whether the key was found in the cache (`true`) or not (`false`).

### `cache.Delete(key string)`

Removes a key-value pair from the cache.

- `key`: The key to delete.

## üí° How it Works

`infux` achieves its high performance and thread safety through a **sharded map** architecture.

  * **Sharding:** The cache is divided into `shardCount` (256 by default) individual `cacheShard` instances. Each shard is an independent map with its own `sync.RWMutex`.
  * **Hashing:** When a key is used for `Set`, `Get`, or `Delete` operations, the FNV-1a hash algorithm is used to determine which shard the key belongs to. This ensures an even distribution of keys across the shards.
  * **Reduced Contention:** By sharding the cache, operations on different keys are likely to hit different shards, thereby minimizing the need for global locks. This significantly reduces lock contention, allowing for much higher concurrency and throughput.
  * **`sync.RWMutex`:** Each shard uses a `sync.RWMutex` to protect its internal map. This allows multiple readers to access a shard concurrently, while writes (and read-write conflicts) are properly synchronized.

The choice of `shardCount = 256` (a power of two) provides a good balance between concurrency benefits and memory overhead, ensuring efficient bitwise operations for shard selection.
